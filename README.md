# Texture-Packing-Scripts-for-GIMP

Scripts to speed up/ simplify texture packing. My main use cases Terrain3D textures with Godot and ORM packing.

Copy to (default install) C:\Program Files\GIMP 2\share\gimp\2.0\scripts

In GIMP go to Filters/Script-Fu/RefreshScripts, after copying files.

Filters/MyScripts to run the scripts.

Needs at least 2 layers to run.
