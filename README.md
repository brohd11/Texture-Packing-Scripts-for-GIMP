# Texture-Packing-Scripts-for-GIMP

Scripts to speed up/ simplify texture packing. My main use cases Terrain3D textures with Godot and ORM packing.

Copy to (default install) C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins

Restart GIMP, after copying files.

Filters/MyScripts to run the scripts.

The scripts that output files will write to the folder that the first image was copied in from.
